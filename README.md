## 🤖 How the AI API is Managed

The application integrates the **Gemini API** using a secure server-side architecture to keep API keys protected:

1.  **Secure Prompt Engineering**: The `lib/aiClient.ts` constructs a specialized prompt that instructs the AI to be extremely concise (1-2 lines), conversational, and to answer _only_ what is asked while providing Markdown-formatted examples.
2.  **API Route Integration**: Requests flow through a Next.js API route (`/api/explain`), which acts as a bridge between the student and the Gemini servers.
3.  **Real-time Streaming Style**: The UI handles loading states via a custom spinner and skeleton pulse while the backend processes the generation.
4.  **Error Handling**: Robust validation ensures that empty queries or API limit issues are communicated gracefully to the student.
